# HAPPY-BIRD
A Flappy Bird–style game created from scratch with HTML Canvas and JavaScript to learn basic game development concepts such as physics, collisions, and game loops.
# 🐦 Flappy Bird (From Scratch)

## 📖 Description
This project is a recreation of the classic game **Flappy Bird**, built completely from scratch using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**. The game uses the **HTML Canvas API** to handle rendering, physics, collision detection, and game logic.

The main goal of this project is to learn the fundamentals of game development while documenting the development process as part of the **Hack Club Flagship** program.

## 🕹️ Features (Planned / In Progress)
- Player-controlled bird with gravity and jump mechanics  
- Randomly generated pipes as obstacles  
- Collision detection  
- Score counter  
- Game over screen and restart functionality  
- Simple custom graphics and sounds
